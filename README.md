### What I learned

I learnt how to incorporate tailwind css into my project for the first time!
Having to use classname for my styling was a major highlight for me.

### Continued development

For future projects, I will learn how to use some CSS properties better with Tailwind CSS especially in the area of margin. margin-top and bottom i.e. "my" in tailwind CSS was an issue for me in this project.
